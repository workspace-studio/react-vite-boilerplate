## Style Guide

As a "base" style guide, the [Airbnb's style guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react) is being used. Since we're applying different eslint configs that are combined with Airbnb's [config](https://yarnpkg.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb), large number of these rules are already enforced.
